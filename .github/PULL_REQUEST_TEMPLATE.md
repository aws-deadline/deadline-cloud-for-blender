### Is this a breaking change?

*delete text starting here*
A breaking change is one that modifies a public contract in some way or otherwise changes functionality of this application in a way
that is not backwards compatible. Examples of changes that are breaking include:

1. Adding a new required value to the init-data or run-data of the adaptor;
2. Deleting or renaming a value in the init-data or run-data of the adaptor; and
3. Otherwise modifying the interface of the adaptor such that a job submitted with an older version of the Blender submitter plug-in
   will not work with a version of the adaptor that includes your modification.

If so, then please describe the changes that users of this package must make to update their scripts, or Python applications. Also,
please ensure that the title of your commit follows our conventional commit guidelines in 
[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/aws-deadline/deadline-cloud-for-blender/blob/mainline/CONTRIBUTING.md#conventional-commits) for breaking changes.
