AWS Deadline Cloud for Blender is a python package that allows users to create [AWS Deadline Cloud][deadline-cloud] jobs from within Blender. Using the [Open Job Description (OpenJD) Adaptor Runtime][openjd-adaptor-runtime] this package also provides a command line application that adapts Blender's command line interface to support the [OpenJD specification][openjd].

## Compatibility

This library requires:

1. Blender 3.6 or greater,
1. Python 3.10 or higher; and
1. Linux, Windows, or a macOS operating system.
   * Adaptor only supports Linux and macOS

## Submitter

This package provides a Blender plugin that creates jobs for AWS Deadline Cloud using the [AWS Deadline Cloud client library][deadline-cloud-client]. Based on the loaded scene it determines the files required, allows the user to specify render options, and builds an [OpenJD template][openjd] that defines the workflow.

### Getting Started

If you have installed the submitter using the Deadline Cloud submitter installer you can follow the guide to [Setup Deadline Cloud submitters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/deadline-cloud/latest/userguide/submitter.html#load-dca-plugin) for the manual steps needed after installation.

If you are setting up the submitter for a developer workflow or manual installation you can follow the instructions in the [DEVELOPMENT](https://github.com/aws-deadline/deadline-cloud-for-blender/blob/mainline/DEVELOPMENT.md#manual-installation) file.
## Adaptor

The Blender Adaptor implements the [OpenJD][openjd-adaptor-runtime] interface that allows render workloads to launch Blender and feed it commands. This gives the following benefits:
* a standardized render application interface,
* sticky rendering, where the application stays open between tasks,

Jobs created by the submitter use this adaptor by default.

### Getting Started

The adaptor can be installed by the standard python packaging mechanisms:
```sh
$ pip install deadline-cloud-for-blender
```

After installation it can then be used as a command line tool:
```sh
$ blender-openjd --help
```

For more information on the commands the OpenJD adaptor runtime provides, see [here][openjd-adaptor-runtime-lifecycle].
